As a chat user
In order to join the chat
I want to select my user name
and join the chat

- if the user isn"t signed in, the app should show a simple view with one input for the user"s nickname
- there should be a simple validation for that input (if the name is empty, don"t leave the page)
- writing down the nickname and pressing enter should redirect the user to chat view
- signing in to the chat should communicate other users that a new person has joined

As a chat user
In order to know who is online
I want to see a list of users and the number of people who are online

- on the chat view. the user should see the number of people available online
- he aforementioned number should be dynamic so that when another user will join or leave, the number will change

As a chat user
In order to talk to other users
I want to send messages to channel and see what another user wrote instantly, without refreshing the page

- There should be an input where new messages can be written
- When the enter key is pressed, the message should be sent
- After sending a message, the input should be cleared
- The message that was sent should be displayed on the messages list
- Other users should see the message that was sent as well

As a chat user
In order to know if other person wrote something on chat
I want to see some kind of notification

- there should be a pop in notification set up for the new incoming messages as a graph next to the username
